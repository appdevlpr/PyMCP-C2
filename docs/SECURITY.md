# Security Protocols

## Encryption
- All communications use TLS 1.3 with perfect forward secrecy
- Payloads are encrypted with AES-256 before transmission
- Encryption keys are derived from environment variables

## Authentication
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration for agent authentication
- Token revocation mechanism for compromised agents
- Secure token storage on agent side

## Obfuscation
- String obfuscation to evade basic signature detection
- Payload compression and encoding
- Random padding to vary network traffic patterns

## Secure Deployment
1. Generate proper SSL certificates (not self-signed for production)
2. Change all default passwords and keys
3. Implement network segmentation
4. Use firewall rules to restrict access
5. Regularly update dependencies for security patches
