## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* An OpenAI API Key (for the AI features)
* Metasploit Framework (optional, for Metasploit integration)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/PyMCP-C2.git
    cd PyMCP-C2
    ```

2. Run the installation script:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/install.sh
    ```

3. Alternatively, install dependencies manually:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd mcp_server && pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd ../mcp_agent && pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd ../mcp_console && pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up environment variables:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your settings
    ```

### Usage

1. **Start the Server:**
    ```bash
    cd mcp_server
    python server.py
    ```

2. **Run an Agent:**
    ```bash
    cd mcp_agent
    python agent.py --server-url https://your-server-ip:443
    ```

3. **Launch the Operator Console:**
